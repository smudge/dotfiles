# smudge's dotfiles

These are very much a work-in-progress. My goal is to use these to maintain similar working environments across multiple computers. These will be primarly focused on macOS.

## getting started

### macOS

After cloning this repo, simply type:

```
./setup.sh
```

You'll then want to manually copy and edit these configs into your home dir. BE CAREFUL with the git config, since it sets my author name and email!

### windows

Most of the doftile configs will not work on windows, but there is still a basic setup script which relies on `scoop` instead of `brew`:

```
setup.bat
```
