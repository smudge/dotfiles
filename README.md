# smudge's dotfiles

These are very much a work-in-progress. My goal is to use these to maintain similar working environments across multiple computers. These will be primarly focused on macOS.

## getting started

After cloning this repo, simply type:

./setup.sh

You'll then want to manually copy and edit these configs into your home dir. BE CAREFUL with the git config, since it sets my author name and email!
